## Introduction to Wacky Flip

Wacky Flip is an innovative physics-based browser game that combines the thrill of parkour with the precision of gymnastics. In Wacky Flip, players take on the role of a virtual athlete performing increasingly complex backflips and aerial maneuvers across various challenging environments. The game's realistic physics engine makes every flip in Wacky Flip feel authentic and rewarding when executed perfectly.

## Gameplay Mechanics

The core gameplay of Wacky Flip revolves around timing and precision. Players must master three key phases in Wacky Flip:

1. &zwnj;**The Jump**&zwnj;: Hold and drag to set power and angle
2. &zwnj;**The Flip**&zwnj;: Time your mid-air rotation
3. &zwnj;**The Landing**&zwnj;: Stick the perfect dismount

What makes Wacky Flip unique is its progressive difficulty system. Early levels in Wacky Flip teach basic flips, while advanced stages introduce obstacles, moving platforms, and combo requirements. The Wacky Flip physics system accurately simulates momentum, rotation speed, and landing impact.
